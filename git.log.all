Author: Andreas Schildbach <andreas@schildbach.de>
Date:   Mon Mar 7 17:38:08 2016 +0100

    Wallet: Get rid of the concept of a "base fee". Fee is always expressed as a rate in Coin per 1000 bytes.
    
    SendRequest.fee was removed; use SendRequest.feePerKb for requesting a specific fee rate. If the field
    was read for knowing the calculated fee, use SendRequest.tx.getFee() instead.
    
    Also makes a couple of unit tests independent of fee and renames the wallet-tool option --fee to
    --fee-per-kb.

    DeterministicKeyChain: Print birth date of watching key in toString().

commit 9aed8ea0a57ae6091260017006a1fd66cb49992b
Author: Andreas Schildbach <andreas@schildbach.de>
Date:   Thu Mar 3 16:53:38 2016 +0100

    For watching wallets, store the key creation time always in the watching key rather than the
    DeterministicKeyChain. Creation times in the DeterministicKeyChain can't be persisted to protobuf,
    as that structure has no full-blown protobuf equivalent.
    
    This means a couple of DeterministicKeyChain, KeyChainGroup and Wallet factory method variants
    that take creation dates have been removed. On the other hand, a convenient
    Wallet.fromWatchingKeyB58(params, xpub, creationDate) has been added.
    
    Also adds a test for protobuf-roundtripping watching wallets.
    
    Supposed to fix issue #1209.

    Change fee calculation in Wallet.adjustOutputDownwardsForFee():
    
    - Cent rule is removed
    - Fee based on feePerKb is calculated on byte precision
    
    This change affects the special cases of emptying and rekeying wallets. Fee calculation of standard transactions is unaffected for now.

    TransactionConfidence: Add lastBroadcastedAt, the time a transaction was last announced to us.
    
    The idea of this new field is that if a pending transaction was not announced for a longer time,
    it is unlikely to confirm. Thus, the user should be warned and maybe the transaction removed from
    the wallet at some point.

    Rate limit peer discovery
    
    This changes PeerGroup to consider a peer discovery that doesn't return
    enough results as a failure, so it does exponential backoff. Otherwise
    it discovers constantly on a network with less than the maximum peers
    available.
    
    Also added a second sanity check to ensure it's never done more than
    once a second.

    Correct coinbase height script validation
    
    Changes coinbase height validation to check for the bytes at the start of
    the coinbase script, and ignore everything after them. The validation then
    matches Bitcoin Core.
    
    Also update error messages to more closely match latest Bitcoin Core.

    Clean up MessageSerializer to simplify subclasses
    
    By replacing MessageSerializer with an abstract class, methods which

    subclasses only have to override a single abstract method instead of
    multiple.

    Ensure "OP_0" and "false" have the same represenstation on stack
    
    During the script execution via `executeScript()` certain operations
    add boolean values to the stack.
    
    Boolean values, which are added to the stack as result, are represented
    as follows in Bitcoin Core:
    
    - `true`: as vector with one element: `[1]`
    - `false`: as empty vector with zero elements: `[]`
    
    See:
    
    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/48efbdbe986355bd2478f0fdd366b20952fbf30a/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L244
    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/48efbdbe986355bd2478f0fdd366b20952fbf30a/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L246
    
    However, in BitcoinJ the representation of `false` differs in some
    cases, where it is represented as Byte array with one element, which
    is zero: `[0]`
    
    See:
    
    - `OP_EQUAL`: https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/blob/5dcf6439755ac5db6e151ba4403b5d3e8bf792eb/core/src/main/java/org/bitcoinj/script/Script.java#L1025
    - `OP_CHECKSIG`: https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/blob/5dcf6439755ac5db6e151ba4403b5d3e8bf792eb/core/src/main/java/org/bitcoinj/script/Script.java#L1304
    - `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`: https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/blob/5dcf6439755ac5db6e151ba4403b5d3e8bf792eb/core/src/main/java/org/bitcoinj/script/Script.java#L1381
    
    At minimum this has an impact on the behavior of `OP_EQUAL` and
    `OP_EQUALVERIFY`, when comparing something with `OP_FALSE`/`OP_0`.
    
    This commit attemps to fix the issue, to mirror the verification
    behavior of Bitcoin Core, by adding empty Byte arrays to the stack,
    instead of Byte arrays with `0`.

    Add BIP 34 enforcement
    
    This patch primarily enforces block height being present in the coinbase
    transaction input, altough it introduces a number of other fixes and
    changes to support this.
    
    * VersionTally now returns the number of blocks at or above a version, rather than just at, to enable forward-compatible support (i.e. v3 blocks include all v2 block tests)
    * Block version is now explicitely provided in most tests which generate blocks, in order to ensure correct tests are applied
    * Block height is now used when generating coinbase transactions
    * Added support for the chain parameters to determine which tests apply to a block, so altcoins can override the defaults if needed.
    * Added initial checks ahead of full BIP 66 validation checks

    Add constructor for use when a block is contained within another object (i.e. AuxPoW header)
    
    Add parseTransactions() method which takes in a payload offset, so block parsers can indicate that transactions do not start at byte 80.
    
    Extract common interface from BitcoinSerializer to support alternative serializers, as well as dummy serializer for message classes which do not have their network parameters.
    
    Thread BitcoinSerializer through messages in place of existing parseLazy and parseRetain properties.
    
    Insert dummy serializer into message subclasses when deserialized by Java.
    
    Replace calls to construct Block/Transaction classes from payloads, with calls to MessageSerializer, so alternative formats can be supported elegantly.

    LinuxSecureRandom: do a few more sanity tests on /dev/urandom.
    
    Nobody has ever heard of an Android device that doesn't have a working /dev/urandom and if one doesn't exist we can't do anything useful anyway, so this patch should be a no-op. It isn't a response to any problem report, but the blockchain.info RNG failure caused us to look at this code again and spot ways it could be more conservative.

    We still use TorDiscovery for networks where we don't have any Cartographer seeds. Switch to OkHTTP because the standard Java HTTP client doesn't let you customise the socket factory and thus cannot be used via Tor directly (doh).

    PeerGroup: use a default FP rate that's much lower than the current rate, to boost performance. As there are various well documented de-anonymization attacks on Bloom filtering in bitcoinj (and BreadWallet) wasting bandwidth without getting additional privacy benefit doesn't help us much, so may as well take the performance until one day the code is smart enough to lie convincingly.

    PeerGroup: stall handling tweak: specify default bandwidth requirement in terms of block headers per second and make much lower, to avoid having false stalls when the Bloom FP rate is lowered (and thus bandwidth required is much lower). It's unclear how useful stall handling will be after this change, but we'll experiment with it a bit and find out.

commit 82a0ddd4de60e7cec3893cbf68be5ef123a7de04
Author: Mike Hearn <mike@plan99.net>
Date:   Sun Apr 19 15:55:10 2015 +0100

    Wallet: Provide new balance types to calculate balances excluding watching outputs. This is useful for wallets where transactions have been manually added and thus there is a mix of watching and non-watching transactions. The "new in 0.13" behaviour that getBalance(AVAILABLE) includes unspendable outputs is preserved, so the more typical approach of having a watching wallet and calling getBalance() still does what you expect and reports the balance of the watched wallet.
    
    API change: send completion would previously include watched outputs and could therefore throw MissingPrivateKeyException. This has now changed so watched outputs won't be considered and thus the exception may change to be InsufficientMoneyException, unless completing a pre-prepared transaction that is already connected to watched outputs.

    Bug fix: don't pointlessly download a transaction we already have because we're broadcasting it.
    
    This is a regression caused by the TxConfidenceTable rewrite: previously it pinned entire transactions and that was used to notice that a broadcast was happening. Now it only pins confidence objects. So instead we use the confidence.source property: if it's SELF then we assume we have it somewhere in the address space and don't bother downloading it when a peer announces it. If it's UNKNOWN then PeerGroup.broadcastTransaction will set it to SELF.

    Rewrite TxConfidenceTable to actually track confidence objects. Make Transaction.getConfidence() fetch the object from the table via the context. This allows us to simplify large chunks of code quite considerably. Note that confidence listeners are not yet pinning the attached confidence to the root set, so the same old bugs remain if you don't pin the tx object. That will be fixed next.

    Make the Context object be a global object that is propagated between threads, and created on demand in the PeerGroup constructor. This isn't complete but is a sketch of where we might go. Context propagation is mostly auto-magical at the moment and will become less so with time, making it easier to use multiple instances of the library from the same thread simultaneously. At the moment you would potentially hit issues if using multiple instances from the same thread though and we should fix that before landing (aka don't break devrandom).

Author: Kalpesh Parmar <kparmar1@hotmail.com>

    1) Update the full stores to return UTXO transactions.
    2) The wallet can now use a UTXOProvider to create spends.
    3) Updated MySQL field blob size.  It's capacity isn't sufficient.
    4) Updated internal objects to be able to cope with a null parent tx (spend free standing outputs).

    Slightly different attempt to fix thread safety issue in PeerGroup to in #278 - make connectTo always locked. It used to be that we couldn't do this but there are no comments reminding me why not, and unit tests + wallettemplate seem happy with it being locked, so I think changes in the network code since then have probably removed this issue.

Author: Mike Hearn <mike@plan99.net>
Date:   Wed Nov 19 15:50:22 2014 +0100

    ECKey/DeterministicKey: replace ECPoint with a LazyECPoint wrapper that doesn't delays parsing of key bytes into a key structure until it's needed. The process of decoding keys from the wallet previously involved decompressing/recompressing them which was taking ~seconds for hundreds of keys on Dalvik/2012 era Androids. After this patch loading such a wallet takes a few hundred milliseconds, most of which is spent inside RIPEMD160.

Date:   Thu Nov 13 22:45:52 2014 +0100

    Rewrite how peer group manages connections and its internal thread:
    
    - No longer uses Guava services, the change is source compatible but the two-step API is no longer needed
    
    - Now has a dedicated ScheduledExecutorService as its core service thread, so we can schedule jobs for the future instead of using sleeps.
    
    - Connection code was rewritten to be easier to follow (at least I think so).
    
    The goal here is to generalise the peer group thread so it can do more things.

    - new Date() is used for formatting which does not specify a locale

    2) Thanks to Ed Lee - Fixed Issue 447 : H2 store: block header hash code is off by 4 bytes. This fix also applies to Postgres and MySQL stores.
    3) Added a coinbase field to the openoutputs table and updated code to use this value.
    4) Updated field type of ‘value’ in the openoutputs table from bytes to long.
    5) Updated the stores (DatabaseFullPrunedBlockStore) with a compatibility check.
    6) Updated field type of ‘addresstargetable’ in the openoutputs table from int to tinyint/smallint.

    Immediately advance current addresses instead of doing it lazily. This avoids a bug whereby an app might quit after using a change address, thus currentKey(CHANGE) == null and it gets reset to the last used address when the wallet is round-tripped.
    
    Unit tests didn't catch this because they didn't simulate the app terminating after the send, and weren't explicitly checking that the change address was different, so improve tests to do those things.
    
    Additionally implement marking as used for married wallets.

    PeerGroup improvements:
    
    1) Don't hold the PeerGroup lock across DNS discovery, otherwise the API is high latency in this period of startup. Fixes issue in Lighthouse where the UI would not appear until DNS resolution had completed.
    
    2) Don't backoff peers that failed due to a first-time connection error.
    
    3) If an IPv6 peer fails to connect due to a NoRouteToHostException, don't try any more IPv6 peers in future.

    Don't fail when deserializing a parentless HD key having depth greater than one.
    
    Currently, deserializing an HD key will fail if both (1) the parent object is null, and
    (2) the hierarchy depth is greater than one.  This patch changes that; rather than
    throwing an exception, the parent is considered to be the root of the deterministic hierarchy.

    HD Wallets: final part needed before release.
    
    If a key is seen in a filtered block that is too far inside our lookahead zone, discard that block and any further blocks being sent to us by a remote peer and recalculate the Bloom filter after more keys are pre-calculated. Then restart the chain download process. This ensures that we can catch up/replay the block chain and keep up with the deterministic key sequence.

    Take only as much time as necessary to open circuits for peer-IP DNS lookups
    
    This patch addresses two suboptimal behaviors in the `TorDiscovery` class:
    
    1. Currently it uses the DNS-lookup timeout as the timeout for opening
       circuits as well as for actually looking up the IP numbers.  It may
       be this timeout value, which is five seconds hard-coded into the
       `PeerGroup` class, was not intended for this purpose.  Moreover,
       the `TorConfig` class has a value, circuitBuildTimeout, apparently
       for this purpose; at least its default of 60 seconds may be more
       appropriate for this purpose than the five-second lookup timeout.
    
    2. Currently, the process of opening circuits for the DNS lookups will
       take exactly as long as the timeout value, no more, no less, which
       practically guarantees that the client will either wait longer than
       necessary, or else experience timeout errors that could have been
       avoided by waiting a bit longer.
    
    The changes herein use the return value of`TorConfig.getCircuitBuildTimeout()`
    as the timeout for opening circuits, rather than using the DNS lookup
    timeout value that is passed by `PeerGroup` as an argument to
    `PeerDiscovery.getPeers()`.  Moreover, as soon as a circuit either has
    been opened or failed to be opened for each router, the DNS lookups
    then begin without waiting for the timeout time to elapse.
    
    Notes:
    
    1. There are no tests with these changes.  There don't seem to be any
       tests for the `TorDiscovery` class.  There probably ought to be.
    
    2. The `TorDiscovery` class's DNS lookup procedure has the same
       timeout characteristic as the one this patch removes from the
       circuit-opening procedure, namely it waits for as long as the
       timeout value, no more no less.  If the changes proposed in this
       patch are acceptable, I would consider making the same change for
       the process of looking up the peer IP numbers.

    Signers: Share keypaths for watching wallets
    
    Now LocalTransactionSigner populates ProposedTransaction.keyPaths map even if
    there is no private key in the wallet. Other signers may take advantage
    of that.

    Payment channel API. Negotiation af the channel duration.
    1. Client requests a time window, in seconds relative to now.
    2. Server suggests an expire time, absolute time in seconds
    3. Client accepts or rejects the servers proposal.
    Note that the IPaymentChannelClient.ClinentConnection interface has a new method. This will break old implementations.
    Let the client request the duration of a payment channel. Server can set allowed time window.

    Transaction.verify: make it throw VerificationException subclasses, and add a check for duplicated outpoints.
    
    This check does not have any impact on existing apps as in full verification mode the UTXO set is already effectively performing this check, and general SPV wallets don't verify inputs meaningfully anyway (they could just be random). However it's useful for Lighthouse and can't hurt - a tx with a duplicated outpoint is always invalid.

    Instead of useDummySignatures flag there is now a MissingSigMode enum
    allowing to specify what to do with missing signatures.
    
    Available modes:
    USE_OP_ZERO - do nothing. OP_0 will be left in place of missing
    signature
    USE_DUMMY_SIG - insert dummy signature in place of missing sig.
    THROW - throw an exception. It would be either MissingSignatureException
    for P2SH or MissingPrivateKeyException for other tx types
    
    Default mode is USE_DUMMY_SIG (for backward compatibility)

    Make LocalTransactionSigner to sign P2SH inputs.
    
    Transaction inputs are now prepopulated with empty scriptSig. Each signer
    is expected to update this scriptSig with a signature at a proper place.
    There is a new method in RedeemData to locate index of the key/signature
    within scriptSig/program.
    To generalize an above approach for all supported types of inputs,
    RedeemData can now represent data for any type of input. For
    pay-to-address and pay-to-pubkey inputs it is expected to contain single
    key and CHECKSIG program.
    
    Signers now accept ProposedTransaction object that could carry additional
    metadata shared between signers. For now it shares derivation path of the
    signing key.
    
    To preserve the dummy sig feature, a new flag was introduced in a SendRequest.
    It specifies whether to fill empty sigs with dummies during tx completion
    or not. Default value is true (for backward compatibility).
    
    There is a CustomTransactionSigner class that may be used as a base for
    simple third-party signers (or may be not). It is used in unit test which
    may be treated as a usage example.

    HDW: Add a getKeyByPath() method to wallet, and (experimental) sanity check precomputed keys before they're returned by the wallet API to guard against the potential of a bitflip in either the stored pubkey bytes, or the ECC precomputed tables. The chance of such a bit flip is small but such flips HAVE been seen in the wild against other bitcoin implementations, so it could happen to a bitcoinj user too. The consequences can be catastrophic (destroyed money) so best to try and do what we can.

    Take out the redundant SigHashType parameter to wallet.signTransaction.
    
    In the end the API evolved in such a way that changing this param isn't that useful. To do contracts you tend to work with transactions directly, and a Wallet subclass that needs to do special signing by default can override the signing engine used.

    Pluggable signers: simple local KeyBag signer
    
    Introduced pluggable signers notion. Instances of
    TransactionSigner could be added into the wallet, so that they subsequently
    applied to transaction to complete it.
    Existing signing code (Transaction.signInputs) was refactored into
    LocalTransactionSigner, which is always implicitly added to any wallet.

    Payment channel extension should be able to be initialized in two steps:
    
    * A constructor that only takes the wallet as an argument
    
    * A setTransactionBroadcaster() which should be called when the Bitcoin network is ready
    
    Motivation: Some wallets (MultiBitHD) does not use WalletAppKit, and starts with reading the wallet before initializing the bitcoin network.
    Now these wallets can create the wallet (and the wallet file is read), and call the setter after the bitcoin network is up.

    HD wallets: experimental change to not trigger full lookahead when deriving keys. This allows a savvy app to get keys/addresses at startup fast, if they do so before starting up the peergroup (which wants all keys in the zone so it can calculate a Bloom filter).

    HD Wallets: fix key lookahead and auto-advance so it works as intended.
    
    Previously the codepath that was supposed to mark keys as used didn't work, and the lookahead calculation wasn't quite right. Now the current key advances correctly when an inbound tx is found that spends to it, including pending transactions. Additionally the lookahead zone now has the threshold zone after it, not inside it, meaning that if you request a lookahead size of 100 keys you'll actually always have at least 100 keys, never less.

    Prevent marriage of used keychain
    
     addFollowingAccounts method now has the check that active keychain has no keys in use. This would prevent divergence of derivation paths for followed and following keys. In future this behaviour should be replaced with some sort of key rotation.

    Improvement of getFollowingKeys
    
    First of all, freshAddress was actually asking for a fresh key twice for non-married keychain. That was fixed by moving first call (needed only for married chain) inside the getFollowingKeys. As the latter now started to return all keys in a marriage and not only following ones, it was renamed to freshMarriedKeys.
    Having all the keys in one block allows to do simple derivation path check to make sure keychains are in sync (as per @devrandom suggestion)

    Changes to the `Coin` class: some convenience comparison operators;
    `parseCoin()` now accepts negative values; the check for an excessive
    value is moved to the constructor from `parseCoin()` and uses
    `checkArgument()`; some `Coin`-type constants broken out into one
    `long` one `Coin` in order to be usable in the constructor.
    Corresponding tests included.  The `BitcoinURI` class constructor
    throws exception on parsing a negative amount, which is needed now
    that `Coin` class accepts negative amounts.

    Fixed VarInt serialization bug for the 0xffffffff number. Fixed VarInt sizeOf bug for the 0xffffffff number and added tests for VarInt edge cases.
    
    The 4294967295 number (0xffffffff) was incorrectly serialized because the UnsignedInteger.MAX_VALUE.longValue() helper returned 4294967295 instead of expected 4294967296.
    
    The VarInt.sizeOf() incorrectly returned 9 instead of 5 for the 4294967295 (0xffffffff) number.

    HD wallet: currentKey is now stable after serialization roundtrip
    
    At the moment currentKeys map of KeyChainGroup is not restored after
    deserialization and subsequent call to currentKey produces different
    key then expected.
    Proposed solution reconstructs currentKey map on deserialization using
    stored numbers of issues keys. It is
    not future-proof as it assumes only RECEIVE and CHANGE keys are being
    used.

    Fixed bitcoinj DoS. It could have been crashed by a malicious message.
    
    Bitcoinj can be crashed with OutOfMemory by sending a message with
    a large claimed var_str length or bytes array length.
    
    The actual message size does not matter, it's the claimed length that matters.
    
    This affects all bitcoinj-based apps that receive messages including Multibit, Android Bitcoin Wallet, Mycelium and Hive.
    
    The fix limits accepted length to max message size (32 MB).

    Minor refactorings and fixes in VersionMessage.
    
    * Fixed toString() bug.
    * Updated comments to match present Bitcoin Core behavior with respect to User-Agent.
    * Removed constructor accepting a boolean. This changes public API but neither multibit
      nor bitcoin-wallet nor mycelium nor hive-android uses this version of constructor.
      The rationale is to avoid passing a boolean to a method as this makes code hard to read.
      Client classes updated to preserve original semantic. All tests pass.

    Breaks dependency cycle between Script.<clinit>, Script.<init> and NetworkParamenters.<init>. Resolves issue #549.
    
    Script.<clinit> depended both on Script.<init> and NetworkParameters.<init> to prepare ScriptChunk cache.
    
    At the same time NetworkParameters.<init> depended on Script.<clinit> by using Script.writeBytes().
    
    The fix frees Script.<clinit> from both the NetworkParameters and Script objects.
    
    This should remove the root cause behind NetworkParameters construction not being thread safe.

    Renamed 'bytes', 'msg' to 'payload' in all Message classes.
    
    * This is intended to clarify distinction between full message and its payload to match terminology advertised on https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification.
    * Does not change public API.
    * These refactorings were mostly automated and should not introduce bugs. All tests pass.

    HD Wallets: mark the DeterministicKeys as issued, if seen in a Transaction
    
    If a Transaction contains a DeterministicKey of our
    DeterministicKeyChains, then we should mark this key as issued. This can
    happen, when we replay/resync the blockchain or when another device uses
    one of our keys.

    HD Wallets: add a threshold for the DeterministicKey lookahead
    
    DeterministicKeyChain.maybeLookAhead() would pre-generate a new key, for
    every issued key, even if it is only one. If we replay the blockchain
    and update the issuedKeys counter, maybeLookAhead() would trigger the
    regeneration and resending of the bloom filter for every used key.
    
    This patch adds a threshold, where keys are only pre-generated after
    more keys are needed than the value of the threshold.

    Refactorings.
    
    Make a convenience ECKey.decrypt(KeyParameter) that doesn't require the keycrypter to be manually specified, as often (always?) the key knows it already.
    
    Introduce a KeyBag interface that just contains findKeyBy* methods, then make Wallet implement it and change Transaction.signInputs to use it. Take out the encrypted-key specific stuff here: Transaction now requires unencrypted keys. Create a DecryptingKeyBag class that just forwards calls to Wallet and decrypts the returned keys. This decouples the signing code from Wallet a bit.
    
    Should be all API compatible.

    Require PeerFilterProviders to expose a lock, and use them to avoid a race that occurs during Bloom filter construction.
    
    It's possible in some uses to cause the Wallet to create two batches of keys one after the other, but independently such that the second batch of keys is derived (with HDWs) whilst the filter is being recalculated from the first. This in turn could race with filter calculation and cause asserts or miscalculated filters.

    Remove incorrect execution of OP_0. That code was never reached, because OP_0 is not an opcode in terms of chunk.isOpCode()). However, it lead to believe that OP_0 pushes the vector [0], rather than correctly the empty vector to the stack.
    
    Because the code was never executed, this bug could never trigger a test. Afaict, script.cpp does not have the corresponding case in its switch block.

    Fixes a 60 second hang that could occur in wallet-tool once the send request was processed. Fixing this revealed another bug - WalletTool was depending on this VM shutdown delay caused by the worker pool timeout, so clean up the code and replace with a blocking get of the future.
    
    Also support the --offline and --password flags when using the payment protocol.

    More memory optimisations.
    
    Run the wallet txConfidenceListener on the calling thread. Move tx broadcast that occurs inside setTransactionBroadcaster outside the wallet lock to avoid inverting on the mempool class (via PeerGroup, but that doesn't lock on the broadcast path).
    
    This makes memory usage smoother by avoiding the creation of tons of closures and spamming the event thread with them.

    Memory optimisations to avoid OOM when the user thread falls behind.
    
    - Remove needless recalculations of the Bloom filter on any wallet change, instead of just when keys/scripts are added. This may fix one of the privacy leak issues too.
    - Run fast catchup/filter recalculations on the dedicated PeerGroup thread instead of abusing the user thread. Resolves a TODO.
    - Replace the user thread SingleThreadedExecutor with a custom class that blocks the submitting thread and logs a warning if the queue is saturated, to avoid building up a backlog of closures.

    Rewrite the network stack.
    
    Remove Netty entirely, using the new Nio wrapper classes instead
    
    * BitcoinSerializer now uses ByteBuffers directly instead of
      InputStreams.
    * TCPNetworkConnection and NetworkConnection interface deleted,
      Peer now extends the abstract class PeerSocketHandler which
      handles deserialization and interfaces with the Nio wrapper
      classes.
    * As a part of this, all version message handling has been moved
      to Peer, instead of doing it in TCPNetworkConnection.
    * Peer.setMinProtocolVersion() now returns a boolean instead of a
      null/non-null future which holds the now-closing channel.
    * Peer.sendMessage (now PeerSocketHandler.sendMessage()) now
      returns void.
    * PeerGroup has some significant API changes:
      * removed constructors which take pipeline factories,
        makePipelineFactory, createClientBootstrap
      * Replaced with a setSocketTimeoutMillis method that sets a
        timeout between openConnection() and version/verack exchange.
        (Note that because Peer extends AbstractTimeoutHandler, it has
        useful timeout setters public already).
      * connectTo returns a Peer future, not a ChannelFuture
      * removed peerFromChannelFuture and peerFromChannel
    * Peer and PeerGroup Tests have semi-significant rewrites:
      * They use actual TCP connections to localhost
      * The "remote" side is a InboundMessageQueuer, which queues
        inbound messages and allows for writing arbitrary messages.
      * It ignores certain special pings which come from pingAndWait,
        which is used to wait for message processing in the Peer.
      * Removed a broken test in PeerGroupTest that should be reenabled
        if we ever prefer a different version than our minimum version
        again.
      * Removed two duplicate tests in PeerTest (testRun_*Exception)
        which are tested for in badMessage as well.
      * Added a test for peer timeout and large message deserialization

    Wallet: improve double spend handling.
    
    Now connects all inputs of an overriding transaction, meaning balance is correct if a bit-tweaked but semantically identical transaction double spends its shadow (e.g. during key rotation on a cloned device).
    
    Still does not recursively kill transactions however.

    Payment channels: bump protocol version.
    
    The protocol gained a PAYMENT_ACK message and now requires a min payment up front. Thus, it is incompatible with previous versions.

commit fc70f7362d5c5884c713f54c367ecc816d7b49c6
Author: Mike Hearn <mike@plan99.net>
Date:   Wed Nov 13 16:30:18 2013 +0100

    Payment channels: require a minimum payment to initiate.
    
    This is a (backwards incompatible) protocol change that prevents clients or servers getting into a situation where they have opened a channel that they then cannot close because insufficient value has been transferred.
    
    The server is allowed to specify the minimum payment it requires in order to open any channel at all, and the client then sanity checks that. Currently the rule is very simple - the min payment must be equal to the hard-coded dust limit. In future it will get more complicated as the dust limit starts to float and a more nuanced risk analysis may become required.

commit 0bc28781ae3fdb049f2dd970f2a9b7a4640ddafb
Author: Mike Hearn <hearn@google.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 12 13:37:46 2013 +0100

    Payment channels: rename "close" to "settle".
    
    The previous overloading of the term "close" to mean both settlement of the channel (broadcast of the final payment tx) and terminating/cleaning up the underlying network connection was very confusing and made the code harder to work with. The notion of "closing" a protocol that is often embedded inside others isn't really well defined, so there's perhaps more work to do here, but this change makes the code easier to follow and is basically a big pile of no-ops.

    Wallet: improved risk analysis.
    
    Extract out the "is time locked" risk analysis code to a pluggable implementation.
    Ensure the default implementation has 100% test coverage.
    Consider finality, not merely the presence of a lock time, when judging risk.
    Don't consider a tx risky if it would become final in the next  block.
    Do not consider self-created transactions risky.

    Tweak broadcast logic again.
    
     Now broadcast to half the connected peers immediately, and wait until half of the rest (i.e. a quarter) have announced the tx. This should give some robustness against a random subset of peers silently swallowing transactions.

    Payment channels: add payment acks.
    
    Add a new PAYMENT_ACK message to the protocol. Make incrementPayment return a future that completes when the server has acknowledge the balance increase.
    
    Also, prevent users from overlapping multiple increase payment requests.
    
    This resolves race conditions that can occur when the billed-for activity is asynchronous to the protocol in which the micropayment protocol is embedded. In this case, it was previously impossible to know when the async activity could be resumed as it would otherwise race with the process of the server checking the payment signature and updating the balance. Most applications of micropayments will use a single protocol that has been extended with an embedding, and thus this is not an issue. However in some rare applications the payment process may run alongside the existing protocol rather than inside it. In this case, payment acks should be used for synchronization.

    Refactor/bugfix broadcast of pending transactions when a peergroup starts up.
    
    Previously the PeerGroup itself would broadcast the pending transactions by simply sending an inv with them all to every peer. This is a good way to get a transaction blasted out if there are no problems with it, but it means we cannot track propagation and the numBroadcastPeers() value was correspondingly not increased. This seems to be causing issues with the Android wallet. So try out a different approach - have the wallet use broadcastTransaction as per normal on the PeerGroup when it's added. The TX will be propagated and watched as with a normal spend.

    Payment channels: bug fixes and improved close behaviour.
    
    The client now has a new CLOSED state, which is entered once a CLOSE has been sent and the close transaction (final contract) has been broadcast onto the P2P network and entered the wallet. Once received, the hash of the close tx is stored in the wallet - the tx is itself already in the wallets spent pool because it connects to the output of the multisig tx. After seeing three confirmations of the close TX the state is deleted from the client wallet for good.
    
     Together these changes resolve a bug/design issue in which if a channel was opened, then closed, then another channel was opened but not closed, then a third attempt to connect to the server was made, the client would try to resume the first closed channel. That would fail because the server already deleted its state object and result in new channels being created even though the second could have been resumed. By tracking the fact that the channel was closed, it can be skipped when considering what channel to resume.

    Delete BoundedOverheadBlockStore.
    
    Although it served us well for a while, it was never actually bounded overhead. Some of its code lives on in SPVBlockStore, which replaces it.

    WalletAppKit: we need a stupid hack to make checkpointing and payment channels work together.
    
    Apparently this simple utility class might start to need unit tests now!
    
    To resolve the hack, we need to resolve some circularity in construction: to add the payment channels wallet extensions requires the peerGroup and wallet object to be constructed, but to construct the peerGroup requires the chain+store and to checkpoint a fresh store requires the wallet. Catch 22! We resolve by loading a temp wallet and then throwing it away, which is inefficient for a large wallet that's being replayed but normally shouldn't matter.
    
    Once the payment channels stuff is more mature and tested, we might want to just fold it into the core wallet format.

    Wallet: use a single hashmap to track all transactions, then use it in receive to re-canonicalize the transactions.
    
    Long story short, I'm a shitty programmer it seems. The Wallet will at some point be modified to track just bags of outputs derived from Transaction objects, and Transactions/Blocks will become immutable. At that point there won't be any confusion between mutable data associated with the deserialised objects.
    
    Resolves issue 453.

    Add a demo wallet app that uses JavaFX and Java 8.
    
    The app is not meant to be usable by end users. It is intended to act as a template for people to build custom apps that use contracts. To that end you can get money in, and empty your wallet, but there's no other controls beyond that.
    
    Apps based on this template look professional and have nice animations and visual effects. You can also use this as a way to learn JavaFX.

    Add Gary Rowe's work on dependency verification to the POM.
    
    Just a snapshot of current JARs is used for now. If our dependencies are already compromised we're out of luck, but this is unlikely.

    Rename and rewrite PingService. It
    
    It's now just ForwardingService, doesn't use the "from address" concept anymore, and uses WalletAppKit + balance futures. The new code is much simpler and easier to read.

    Payment channels: tweaks to channel resume behaviour.
    
    Don't create a new channel automatically when the client wants to resume but there's already an open connection using that contract. Instead, disconnect the other client. This fixes unintuitive behaviour that could occur if a TCP connection silently died and the server didn't notice.

Author: Mike Hearn <hearn@google.com>
Date:   Thu Jul 25 15:32:17 2013 +0200

    Payment channels: tweaks to the examples.

Author: Mike Hearn <hearn@google.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 24 13:56:12 2013 +0200

    WalletAppKit: Configure the peergroup with candidate peers before adding wallet extensions, as payment channel state can attempt to broadcast a transaction as soon as the state is loaded/instantiated. This ensures the number of min peers required for broadcast is correct at that point.

    Peer: drop out of fast catchup mode when reaching the top of the chain.
    
    This bug could cause problems if you sync a wallet containing no keys, and then a chain fork happens (you won't follow the fork).

Date:   Fri Jul 19 13:03:35 2013 +0200

    Payment channels: Re-order c'tor of StoredPaymentChannelClientStates.
    
     This makes it consistent with the server side and put the listener last. It's easier to read this way when an anonymous inner class is used.

    Add support classes for hierarchical deterministic wallets (BIP 32)
    
    Code from Matija Mazi. HD wallets allow you to derive keys from a single
    root key, giving various useful features:
    
    - Make a backup once and it's good forever (for your keys only of course)
    - You can break off parts of the tree and give it to other people,
      they can then generate new keys to send you money without any
      involvement by you (better privacy+security for watching wallets)
    - You can delegate sub-trees to other people as a form of access control.

commit 6b7d653614bbc2063339a303064b29d200f626b6
Author: Mike Hearn <hearn@google.com>
Date:   Thu Jun 20 14:47:16 2013 +0200

    Major rework of how confidence listeners are called:
    
    * API change: TransactionConfidence.Listener now takes a reason enum describing the general class of change.
    * Confidence listeners are now invoked in the user code thread as well, thus eliminating any chance of unexpected re-entrancy.
    * The wallet batches up confidence changes and executes them all at the end of major operations, avoiding confusing intermediate transitions that could occur in the previous design.
    * Much code has been simplified as a result and it's now harder to screw up.

commit 5de80dfedfef720a8fb7f63a34bdd8682065c1c9
Author: Mike Hearn <hearn@google.com>
Date:   Wed Jun 19 17:54:19 2013 +0200

    Introduce a user code thread which is used for running event listeners.
    
    This ensures that when user provided event listeners are invoked, we're not holding any locks at that time and thus event listeners can do whatever they want with no risk of accidental inversions or deadlocks. A utility method is available to wait for all preceding events that were triggered to complete, which is useful for unit tests. Reimplement how balance futures work in order to avoid the wallet registering an event handler on itself, this means you cannot accidentally deadlock yourself by running getBalanceFuture().get() inside an event listener.
    
    Future changes will modify how transaction confidence listeners are run to work the same way, and make other kinds of event listener run in the user code thread as well.
    
    The user code mechanism is usable with any executor, opening up the possibility of automatically relaying event listeners into GUI threads for some kinds of apps.

commit 4908c241f7161bc5facfb85b466feba2929f2567
Author: Matt Corallo <git@bluematt.me>
Date:   Wed Jun 26 23:59:56 2013 +0200

    Implement server-side and client-side payment channel protocols.
    
    This implements micropayment payment channels in several parts:
     * Adds PaymentChannel[Server|Client]State state machines which
       handle initialization of the payment channel, keep track of
       basic in-memory state, and check data received from the other
       side, based on Mike Hearn's initial implementation.
     * StoredPaymentChannel[Client|Server]States manage channel
       timeout+broadcasting of relevant transactions at that time,
       keeping track of state objects which allow for channel
       resume, and are saved/loaded as a WalletExtension.
     * Adds PaymentChannel[Client|Server] which manage a connection
       by getting new protobufs, generating protobufs for the other
       side, properly stepping the associated State object and
       ensuring the StoredStates object is properly used to save
       state in the wallet.
     * Adds PaymentChannel[ClientConnection|ServerListener] which
       create TCP sockets to each other and use
       PaymentChannel[Client|Server] objects to create/use payment
       channels.
    
    The algorithm implemented is the one described at
    https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_7:_Rapidly-adjusted_.28micro.29payments_to_a_pre-determined_party
    with a slight tweak to use looser SIGHASH flags so that the
    Wallet.completeTx code can work its magic by adding more inputs if
    it saves on fees.
    
    Thanks to Mike Hearn for the initial state machine implementations
    and all his contracts work and Jeremy Spilman for suggesting the
    protocol modification that works with non-standard nLockTime
    Transactions.

    Add a length-prefixed protobuf connection server/client.
    
    This forms the base for payment channel network connections, with
    a simple single-threaded server which accepts new connections, a
    simple single-threaded client which makes a single connection to a
    server, and a ProtobufParser which handles data generated by a
    connection, splits them into Protobufs and provides a reasonable
    interface to users who wish to create/accept protobuf-based
    connections.

    Fix premature optimization in H2FullPrunedBlockStore (resets state)
    
    This replaces the H2FullPrunedBlockStore schema with one that will
    take (maybe) some more disk space while being a good bit faster.
    The tradeoff made was really not worth it.
    
    Also adds a version field to settings database incase something
    other than schema changes in the future.

    Add optional support native ECDSA (designed for sipa's impl).
    
    This could be significantly more optimized if we avoided crossing

    Wallet: change the extensions API.
    
    The old API was very limiting. Rather than have extensions be a single object that creates subclasses of the Wallet class, allow arbitrary objects to be attached to Wallets. Objects know if they are mandatory and how to serialize themselves. A wallet can have as many extensions as wanted in this way.

    Unlock TransactionConfidence event listeners, make sure MemoryPool is not locked when a tx is marked broadcast by a peer to avoid inversions via listeners.
    Unfortunately this introduces some new FindBugs warnings because it doesn't understand the inside-out locking pattern used here, despite that it's correct.

    Narrow the locking in Peer.processInv() to avoid invoking memoryPool.seen() with the Peer lock held.
    This resolves an inversion that can occur if a transaction confidence listener is run due to being marked as broadcast.

     Change default policy to warn. Now warnings are being triggered, the followup commits will fix them.

    Refactor some of the wallet/peer interaction. Analyze dependencies of relevant pending transactions.
    The Peer object now asks each connected Wallet if it cares about a transaction. If it does, then receivePending() is not called immediately, but rather after downloading of dependencies and with those dependencies. If any dependencies are time locked, a new wallet property controls whether they are discarded or not.

    Give Blocks/Transactions an idea of their optimally-encoded size.
    
    In the case of Blocks/Transactions which are encoded using VarInts
    which are not optimally encoded, we need to compare MAX_BLOCK_SIZE
    with the optimally encoded size, not the actually encoded size.

    Make FullPrunedBlockStore/Chain upgrade-friendly.
    
    This does several things to support the ability to upgrade from a
    BlockChain to a FullPrunedBlockChain backed by the same
    FullPrunedBlockStore:
     * Add two methods to FullPrunedBlockStore to allow it to keep
       track of two chain heads - one verified, one normal.
     * Change preSetChainHead in AbstractBlockChain to doSetChainHead so
       that FullPrunedBlockChain and BlockChain can set only the
       appropriate chain head
     * Add FullPrunedBlockStore.getOnceUndoableStoredBlock.
       This allows a BlockChain to request only StoredBlocks which
       were, at one point, associated with a StoredUndoableBlock,
       effectively splitting FullPrunedBlockStore into two independent
       BlockStores (one FullPruned, one normal).
     * Add/use AbstractBlockChain.getStoredBlockInCurrentScope which
       relies on the above additions to FullPrunedBlockStore to properly
       utilize one FullPrunedBlockStore as two separate block stores
       depending on the BlockChain instance used.
       Note that this is not used everywhere in AbstractBlockChain as,
       barring something being insanely broken, the prev block of a
       block in current scope will be in current scope.

    Some improvements to the network code:
    - Delete the PeerGroupThread and replace it with a connectToAnyPeer() method. Getting connected to the network is now significantly faster as there is no sleep-wait loop between connections.
    - Delete the connectionTimeMillis param to the PeerGroup constructors.
    - Expose the PeerGroup c'tor that lets you specify the ClientBootstrap and expose a utility method to make one. This means users can now customize TCP options directly.
    - PeerGroup.setMaxConnections() now actually creates or tears down connections to meet the new required number, if the peer group is running.
    - Update the PeerMonitor so there's a spinner that lets you add or remove peers. Connecting and version handshaking is very fast now.
    - Misc changes and fixes.

    Add a few Storage classes which avoid storing unnecessary data.
    
    Specifically, this adds:
    * StoredTransaction, which avoid having to store the entire
      transaction when we only need its inputs+outputs.
    * StoredTransactionOutput, which avoids having to store the entire
      parentTransaction just to get the hash and index.
    * TransactionOutputChanges, which is used to store two lists of
      StoredTransactionOutputs, one for the created set and one for
      the spent set.
    * StoredUndoableBlock, which can store either only
      TransactionOutputChanges or only StoredTransactions so that the
      block can be more easily connected/disconnected at will.

    Introduce a concept of "minimum peers for broadcast" to PeerGroup.broadcastTransaction. This can be used to make sending faster when you are bringing up the network in parallel. It defaults to half the max connections. The idea is to insulate you from slow remote peers somewhat.

Author: Mike Hearn <hearn@google.com>
Date:   Sat Jul 21 23:07:00 2012 +0200

    Change PeerGroup.broadcastTransaction() to wait for propagation.
    
    It means a send won't be considered completed until it's accepted by the net.
    Also is for the case where you receive a transaction (eg, via Bluetooth) and
    you want to broadcast it such that you can know it's valid.
    
    Make WalletTool use --peers instead of --peer, a comma separated list of
    addresses to use. Remove the crappy sleep after send now we can wait.
    
    Resolves issue 167.

    Port to the latest BouncyCastle API and switch to the SpongyCastle lightweight API. It has the following benefits:
    
     - Keeps us up to date with the crypto library
     - Resolves the need for an Android artifact by using a renamed lib
     - Switches to the lightweight API so minimizes our dependencies, which is also required for the native branch to be merged

commit d82f102b4b0c4872698b448d68a81df68a52c5b5
Author: Mike Hearn <hearn@google.com>
Date:   Wed Apr 4 21:35:10 2012 +0200

    Introduce a new MemoryPool abstraction and use it for tracking peer confidences. This replaces the previous, less explicit system which had each peer try and track all transactions it'd seen in a per-peer pool.
    
    This makes experimental usage of weak references and a reference queue to make the MemoryPool only bother tracking transactions that were retained by some other part of the program, ie, because they were relevant to the wallet. This stops the memory usage from bloating due to lots of large transactions flying around the network whilst still letting us intelligently monitor how many peers announced transactions without tight coupling between components.
    
    Note that we still need the cap on the pool size because otherwise you could DoS a bitcoinj based program by sending it lots of fake transactions it found interesting. The DoS potential still exists but is a bit different now.

    Split transaction creation into building a template and then completing it. Completing a tx means adding inputs and possibly a change output to make the transaction valid. Also add a convenience addOutput() overload to Transaction. This makes it easier to create multi-sends.

    Use finer grained locking in the BlockChain to make accessing the chain head responsive even whilst the chain is downloading and the object is under heavy load. This takes getChainHead() out of the profiles for ToyWallet and allows for removing the code added there to work around this issue.

    Callbacks for when a transaction in the chain is seen that spends coins from our wallet, not just to.
    Introduce EventListenerInvoker to simplify the pattern by which event listeners can delete themselves safely whilst running.
    Update the ToyWallet app to accept a public key:creation time pair on the command line and show all relevant transactions, to demonstrate (very crudely) the watching functionality.

    Rework how event listeners are called, so tx confidences are updated at the end of the receive process. Otherwise it's possible for the wallet to get confused because the state can change in the middle of processing. Document this and add a test. Update PingService. Also, change onCoinsReceived so it's only called once per transaction, to know when a tx appears in a block requires registration of a tx confidence listener.

    First cut at transaction confidence levels. Expose a TransactionConfidence object that is updated by peers and wallets, which tracks how many peers have announced the transaction and the height of the transaction in the best chain (if any). Unit tests that check it does the right thing with re-orgs. Various small cleanups and simplifications in the tests.

    Make ECKey store its creation time. Implement fast catchup using the getheaders command. You can now set a date on a Peer/PeerGroup, before which block bodies will not be fetched. After that they will. Using the date of the earliest key in the wallet means new users can get started faster and with less battery drain as they aren't parsing blocks that are guaranteed to have no relevant transactions.

    Some changes to PeerGroup and how we manage the download process:
    - Have a dominant peer that is responsible for all data downloads. This eliminates the case of multiple threads fighting over download of the block chain and wasting time/bandwidth duplicating work.
    - Make NetworkConnection an interface with two implementations: {TCP,Mock}NetworkConnection
    - Rewrite the Peer/PeerGroup tests to use the mock connection. This simplifies testing of multiple independent peer threads within the same group.
    - Switch off the MOBILE_OPTIMIZED mode as it's no longer required. It may still be useful for the multiplexing proxy project.

    Patch 11 from Steves lazy parsing patchset.
    
    Cache checksum for non-empty messages.
    
    VersionMessage and AddressMessage require some special handling.  VersionMessage because it's never lazy parsed or cached.  AddressMessage because when serializing PeerAddresses the time field is dynamic.
    
    Checksum byte array is currently transient so no gains for a message extracted from java serialization then bitcoinSerialized.  I don't think this would ever happen in real life but if it does then it could also be included in the serialized object.

    Patch 10 from Steves lazy parsing patchset.
    
    Customize Sha256Hash.hashCode() method to only use first n bytes of the backing array.  This provides uniqueness to 256^n combinations.  As hashcode is not required to be guaranteed unique this fulfills the contract and reduces hashing time.
    
    Use case is for applications that do a lot of mapping by Sha256Hash.  Each put and get require several hashcode operations.  Cached hashcode is already implemented in 8.patch.
    
    Similar changes to this yielded huge performance benefits in poolserverj.
    
    There is no point implementing a FastEquals version of equals given the bytes are essentially random and no byte is any more likely unique than another.

    Patch 9 from Steves lazy parsing patchset.
    
    Add UnsafeByteArrayOutputStream.  ByteArrayOutputStreams are used extensively and result in a lot of short lived byte arrays.
    
    This patch contains two optimizations
    
    1/ attempt to provide the final length to ByteArrayOutputStream constructor to avoid constantly resizing the backing array.  Default size is 32 which means larger messages may require several array reallocations and almost all will require at least one.
    
    2/ provides the UnsafeByteArrayOutputStream class which eliminates method synchronization.  The toByteArray() will return the backing array rather than a copy if the correct length was provided in the constructor.
    
    In the worst case scenario this cuts array allocations from 3 to 2.
    In the most common worst case from 3 to 1.
    In most best cases where final array size is greater than 128 bytes from > 4 to 1.

    Patch 8 from Steves lazy parsing patchset.
    
    More optimizations: pre-calculate or guess various array sizes to avoid needlessly re-sizing them later.
    
    Sha256Hash caches the hashCode.
    
    Message classes now track their (estimated) length even when not using deserialization-related constructors.

    Patch 5 from Steves lazy parsing patchset:
    
    Optimise BitcoinSerialiser for Transactions.  When calculating checksum on deserialize use it prepopulate the transaction's hash.  Likewise on serialize check if the Transaction already has a hash and use that to write checksum bytes.  This yields performance improvesment up to 400% by saving on a double hash.
    
    Don't parse all the subcomponents of a Transaction purely to calculate its length, instead do the minimal work possible.
    
    Recaching on a call to bitcoinSerialise().  Prevents double serialization of transactions and inputs/outputs when calculating a merkleroot during block serialization.  Also makes it more likely the original larger byte array can be GC'd

    Second part of Steves lazy parsing patchset:
    
    1) Added getters and setters to many objects that lacked them.
    2) Introduce a parseLite method that is called even in "lazy parse" mode. This calculates the length of the message so children can be skipped when parsing a container object.
    3) Full serialization for AddressMessage
    4) Added a (huge, standalone) SpeedTest.
    5) Add unit tests for the matrix of lazy parsing modes.
    
    A bunch of review comments are added to the TODO list for completion after the patch series is checked in. This is to avoid large numbers of merge conflicts as later parts of the patch-series are committed.

    First part of Steves changes in preparation for a high performance multiplexing proxy:
    
     1) Introduce partial support for caching the underlying byte arrays during message deserialization, so re-serialization can be skipped in the case where a message is not modified.
    
     2) Add c'tors that allow a message to be configured to lazily parse on-demand.
    
     Note that the getters/setters that make lazy parsing transparent are coming in future commits.

    Optimize chain download further by skipping merkle root verification unless there are transactions relevant to a wallet in the block. Refactor some code out of WalletTest into a new static TestUtils class.

    Store 2050 blocks in the BoundedOverheadBlockStore memory cache. This eliminates the delay on difficulty transitions. We now regularly hit 500 blocks per second, ie, we are sender-constrained.

    Replace reflection with an if ladder for deserialization, as reflection was dominating the profiles (60% of all time spent downloading the chain). Takes us from around 250-300 blocks per second to over 400.

Date:   Wed Jul 6 15:30:08 2011 +0000

    Clone cached hash in Block.cloneAsHeader(). Before this hash recalculation was about half the time spent inside BoundedOverheadBlockStore.put(), now it does not appear in the profiles.

Author: Mike Hearn <hearn@google.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 6 15:15:44 2011 +0000

    Optimize Block.cloneAsHeader() which was taking about 25% of the CPU during chain download on Android. The previous implementation was lazy (serialize and deserialize), the new implementation is much faster and not much more complex.
    
    The profiles are now dominated by checking difficulty transitions.

    Use Sha256Hash more consistently, improve the class a bit.
    
    Note that the endianness of the hashes is still very ad-hoc and messy. Next step is to pick an endianness and stick with it, to reduce the number of times reverseBytes is used.

    Add BoundedOverheadBlockStore. This is suitable for usage on constrained devices like Android phones that cannot afford to store the chain headers in RAM.
    
    On a MacBook pro with this store, the chain can be downloaded at about 2000 blocks per second. Difficulty transitions are not optimized but take around 50 msec. On a Google Nexus S the chain can be downloaded (via wifi) at 200 blocks per second and difficulty traversals take 2 seconds. At this time the profiles on both devices are dominated by verification costs, not storage.

    Another rewrite of the re-org handling:
    - Split the unit tests for this into a separate file
    - Add more tests for double spends, reversal of external spends and more edge cases
    - Handle the case where transactions should be resurrected after a re-org
    - Handle the case where transactions are overridden by double spends
    
    Should address [some of] the points Miron raised during his review. There are likely still bugs but it's a lot closer to correct than before.

commit c20118d871a0815f34f15cb549d8a4aec6597875

    Second part of supporting block chain re-orgs. Wallet now organizes transactions into four pools: unspent, spent, pending and inactive. Transactions track which blocks they have appeared in. BlockChain provides the Wallet with both segments of chain and it then moves transactions between the pools as necessary.
    
    Activated the disabled tests in testForking, added a bunch more tests for this functionality.
    
    Added various utility methods and made small fixes as required.
    
    This changes the wallet format and invalidates existing wallets.

Date:   Mon Apr 25 21:52:33 2011 +0000

    Some small protocol fixes. Correct serialization of version and address messages.
    
    Also require the height of the best chain to be specified when setting up a NetworkConnection. This API is getting too complicated and will be simplified soon.
    
    For now these fixes resolve a bug whereby the peer would not send us new blocks discovered during a session (as it thought we already had them).

    Change the order of the messages in the version handshake. This fixes connections to BitCoin nodes beyond v0.30.20.2 which are "shy", that is, they do not announce their version on accepting a connection. The intent of that change is to make port scanning harder, though it is questionable whether this really is effective.

    First part of block chain handling rework.
    
    - Store the block chain using a get/put interface keyed by hash,
      so we can add disk storage later.
    
    - Add unit tests for difficulty transitions. Move some stuff into
      NetworkParameters to make that easier.
    
    - Track the best chain using total work done. Inform the wallet
      when a re-org takes place. Wallet currently doesn't do anything
      with this beyond informing the event listeners.
    
    With this patch we're getting closer to a correct SPV implementation.
